### 1. Project Overview

The rising cost of medical insurance has made it important to predict premium amounts accurately. This project explores machine learning techniques to predict insurance costs, which can assist insurance companies in pricing policies more accurately and fairly.

### 2. Features

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations in the dataset.

  - Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

  - Model building and training using algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.

  - Model evaluation with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### 3. Technologies Used

i. Programming Language: Python

ii. Libraries: 

  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - Jupyter Notebook
### 4. Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

- Introduction: Overview and objectives of the project.

- EDA: Visualization and statistical analysis of the dataset.

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding, and feature scaling.

- Model Training: Building and evaluating machine learning models.

- Results and Insights: Performance metrics and model comparison.

### 5. Results

The best-performing model achieves the following metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### These results indicate the model's ability to predict insurance costs with reasonable accuracy.
